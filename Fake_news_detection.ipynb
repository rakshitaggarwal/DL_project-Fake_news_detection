Turkey just held a referendum that greatly expands the power of their president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. It passed by a very narrow margin, taking Turkey on its latest step toward brutal dictatorship, and here s Donald Trump, who sources say called Erdogan to congratulate him on  winning  the referendum vote.While we re busy justifying blowing up absolutely nothing in Syria because a brutal dictator used sarin gas on his people, Trump is busy calling someone who s working hard on becoming the region s next brutal dictator to congratulate him on furthering that goal.This referendum, according to The Daily Beast, moves Turkey away from a parliamentary democracy and towards one-person rule. But what he has already done there makes the referendum more of a formality. Erdogan had already managed to form a one-party government   a move that greatly diminishes the voices of opposition.Last year, Erdogan asked Turkey s parliament to redefine the country s anti-extremism law to include politicians, journalists and members of academia. He claimed that  pro-Kurdish  politicians were inciting terrorism, and journalists and academics were spreading the info that allowed the politicians to do so. Therefore, they are all terrorists.Branding press as  the enemy  is something Trump has been trying to do here. As the Washington Post s front page motto says,  Democracy dies in darkness.  This is the darkness.And now, Erdogan is, more or less, the sole ruler of Turkey.But what does Trump care? It wouldn t be surprising to find that he wishes something like that would happen here, too, if for no other reason than it would help cement his overinflated opinion of himself as a great man who is beloved by all, with nobody left to shine a light on the truth, like, oh, say, a free press.The way the Turkey referendum was held has appalled international election monitors. According to them,  voters were not provided with adequate information, opposition voices were muzzled and the rules were changed at the last minute.  In short, this was not a truly democratic process.Good job continuing to support authoritarian rulers over true democracies, Trump. You re about as un-American as it gets.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images\",\n          \"Donald Trump just got caught lying again and there is video to prove it.When former FBI Director James Comey testified under oath in the Senate on Thursday, he recalled that Trump demanded loyalty from him before he was asked to drop the investigation of Michael Flynn and Trump s ties to Russia. The President said,  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,  Comey testified.But when asked by ABC reporter Jon Karl if he had demanded Comey s loyalty, Trump denied the whole thing and pretended that he has never demanded loyalty from anyone in his entire life. So he said those things under oath,  Karl began.  Would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of those events? One hundred percent,  Trump replied.  I didn t say under oath   I hardly know the man. I m not going to say, I want you to pledge allegiance. Who would do that? Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath? I mean, think of it. I hardly know the man. It doesn t make sense. No, I didn t say that, and I didn t say the other. If Trump were to say this under oath he would he would be committing perjury. And CNN proved it by playing video of Trump on the campaign trail in Florida asking people in the crowd to raise their hands and pledge their loyalty to him. Keep in mind that Trump had never met anyone in that audience. But he had several discussions and meetings with Comey. In other words, Comey was not a complete stranger to him. If he was willing to ask a crowd of random people to pledge their allegiance to him, he would certainly be willing to demand loyalty from Comey.Here s the damning video via YouTube.This is yet more proof that Trump is a liar who has zero credibility. He will say anything to save his own ass.Featured image via Olivier Douliery   Pool/Getty Images\",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Monday Washington was  very concerned  by reports of violence around the Iraqi oil city of Kirkuk, which was seized by Baghdad s forces from Kurds.

Turkey just held a referendum that greatly expands the power of their president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. It passed by a very narrow margin, taking Turkey on its latest step toward brutal dictatorship, and here s Donald Trump, who sources say called Erdogan to congratulate him on  winning  the referendum vote.While we re busy justifying blowing up absolutely nothing in Syria because a brutal dictator used sarin gas on his people, Trump is busy calling someone who s working hard on becoming the region s next brutal dictator to congratulate him on furthering that goal.This referendum, according to The Daily Beast, moves Turkey away from a parliamentary democracy and towards one-person rule. But what he has already done there makes the referendum more of a formality. Erdogan had already managed to form a one-party government   a move that greatly diminishes the voices of opposition.Last year, Erdogan asked Turkey s parliament to redefine the country s anti-extremism law to include politicians, journalists and members of academia. He claimed that  pro-Kurdish  politicians were inciting terrorism, and journalists and academics were spreading the info that allowed the politicians to do so. Therefore, they are all terrorists.Branding press as  the enemy  is something Trump has been trying to do here. As the Washington Post s front page motto says,  Democracy dies in darkness.  This is the darkness.And now, Erdogan is, more or less, the sole ruler of Turkey.But what does Trump care? It wouldn t be surprising to find that he wishes something like that would happen here, too, if for no other reason than it would help cement his overinflated opinion of himself as a great man who is beloved by all, with nobody left to shine a light on the truth, like, oh, say, a free press.The way the Turkey referendum was held has appalled international election monitors. According to them,  voters were not provided with adequate information, opposition voices were muzzled and the rules were changed at the last minute.  In short, this was not a truly democratic process.Good job continuing to support authoritarian rulers over true democracies, Trump. You re about as un-American as it gets.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images\",\n          \"Donald Trump just got caught lying again and there is video to prove it.When former FBI Director James Comey testified under oath in the Senate on Thursday, he recalled that Trump demanded loyalty from him before he was asked to drop the investigation of Michael Flynn and Trump s ties to Russia. The President said,  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,  Comey testified.But when asked by ABC reporter Jon Karl if he had demanded Comey s loyalty, Trump denied the whole thing and pretended that he has never demanded loyalty from anyone in his entire life. So he said those things under oath,  Karl began.  Would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of those events? One hundred percent,  Trump replied.  I didn t say under oath   I hardly know the man. I m not going to say, I want you to pledge allegiance. Who would do that? Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath? I mean, think of it. I hardly know the man. It doesn t make sense. No, I didn t say that, and I didn t say the other. If Trump were to say this under oath he would he would be committing perjury. And CNN proved it by playing video of Trump on the campaign trail in Florida asking people in the crowd to raise their hands and pledge their loyalty to him. Keep in mind that Trump had never met anyone in that audience. But he had several discussions and meetings with Comey. In other words, Comey was not a complete stranger to him. If he was willing to ask a crowd of random people to pledge their allegiance to him, he would certainly be willing to demand loyalty from Comey.Here s the damning video via YouTube.This is yet more proof that Trump is a liar who has zero credibility. He will say anything to save his own ass.Featured image via Olivier Douliery   Pool/Getty Images\",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Monday Washington was  very concerned  by reports of violence around the Iraqi oil city of Kirkuk, which was seized by Baghdad s forces from Kurds.
